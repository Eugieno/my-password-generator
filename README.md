## Reflection
This was a 3 days long challenge project built during my fifth module at University of Birmingam FE web development Bootcamp. Project goals included using object, data structures and functions in javascript learned up until this point and familiarising myself with how the three web languages (HTML, CSS, JS) integrate to build a simple dynamic web app.

One of the main challenges I ran into was enforcing the app to show ALL of the character options selected by the user despite the randomness of the pick from each character arrays provided in the starter file.
This led me to spend a few hours on a research spike into other array methods that was not covered in the bootcamp lessons; such as "filter". In  the process, I learned other standard methods to achieve same objective.

At the end of the day, the technology implemented in this project are JS, HTML and CSS. However, the principal technology I implemented is JS, as HTML and CSS codes were provided as part of the starter file. In the immediate future, I plan to include the following features to the web app
1. A COPY button to enable user copy the pasword on click if needed
2. Cryptographic security for the generated password
3. More aesthetics
